U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to KTH Royal Institute of Technology on Sept. 4. He will be joined by Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, to get a taste of KTH's research in renewable energy. U.S. President Barack Obama will visit KTH Royal Institute of Technology on Sept. 4. When Barack Obama arrives in Sweden on Wednesday for the first time, it will also mark the first bilateral visit for a U.S. president in Sweden.

The President’s decision to visit Stockholm’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology during his trip says a lot about the research being conducted at the university. He is of course very welcome, says KTH President Peter Gudmundson, Obama’s host for the visit to KTH. Research and education are what we excel in, and therefore it is great that President Obama has chosen the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The visit is expected to last about one half hour on Wednesday afternoon, amid an otherwise extremely tight schedule.

While details are not yet finalized, the President has expressed interest in areas of renewable energy research that KTH’s School of Chemical Science is involved in, such as fuel cells and solar cells. This is a positive signal about KTH's international status, and that we conduct research at the cutting edge, which we are very proud of, Gudmundson says. Research into renewable energy includes creating and developing effective techniques in a world of dwindling and finite resources. This is research for the future that could ultimately be crucial for all of us, Gudmundson says.
