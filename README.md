# topic-extraction


This project is part of my master thesis project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Project Title: Subtopic extraction using graph-based methods.

This code was used to explore subtopic extraction using search engine technology, combined with graph centrality ranking of topic candidates.

More info about the thesis project can be found at: http://www.nada.kth.se/~markusos/thesis/

## Example

Example result file: [result.html](docs/example/result.html)

### Input document:

Encyclopedia Britannicas definition of Tree:

> Tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial).
> Most plants classified as trees have a single self-supporting trunk containing woody tissues,
> and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs, called branches.

### Extracted Topics:

The system extracts the following topics, presented order of the ranking by the system:

1. Tree
2. Perennial plant
3. Plant stem
4. Herbaceous plant
5. Glossary of plant morphology terms

### Candidate Graph:

Extracted Candidate Graph used to rank the topics:

## Setup

### Download:
- Download DBpedia Wikipedia Pagelinks Dataset: [page_links_bg.nt.bz2](http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/dbpedia/2014/bg/page_links_bg.nt.bz2)
- Download and install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- Download and install [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
- Download and install [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) (Used to visualize the Candidate Graphs)

### Configure ElasticSearch

- Copy the stopwords.txt file to the config directory in your ElasticSearch folder.
- Add the following to your 'elasticsearch.yml' config file to use the provided stopword list:
>     index :
>       analysis :
>         analyzer :
>           default :
>             type : standard
>             stopwords_path : stopwords.txt

### Start services:
- Start MongoDB, run 'mongod' from your terminal.
- Start ElasticSearch, run 'elasticsearch' from your terminal.

### Setup the project:
- Extract 'page_links_bg.nt.bz2' in the project directory
- Run the command 'mvn clean install' in the project directory

### Run the topic indexing:

To build the ontology used for the topic extraction we use the DBpedia Wikipedia Pagelinks Dataset.

- Run 'java -jar topic-0.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar -i' to start the indexing.

   Expect the indexing to take several hours, depending on your computer performance and harddrive speed.
   It catalogues the whole link structure from Wikipedia into MongoDB for pre processing and then indexes the data into ElasticSearch.
   Keep an eye on the log.txt file to see the progress and the error.txt to see if any errors occurs.

#### Indexed Data Example

This is an example of the data indexed into ElasticSearch:

## Extract topics

- Run 'java -jar topic-0.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar -e' to extract topics from "input.txt" file.

   You can change the input file in 'com.findwise.topic.extractor.Main' and tweak the parameters for the system.
   When done, the file 'result.html' contains the result as well as the relationship graph of the found topics.
